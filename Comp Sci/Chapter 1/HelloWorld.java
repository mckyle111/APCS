// There's no error. It simply changes the name of the class.
// There is no error message because you are allowed to print any phrase to the screen without affecting the class name.
// The error message reads "unclosed string literal." 
// The error message says that a parenthisee is expected, and when that error is fixed, another error appears. Solving the first error fixes the error.
// The error message reads that a semicolon is expected.
